# Chess

An attempt to recreate chess at varying levels of flexibility.

This project is just to practice some logic, before trying to recreate this simple game on Unity.

This is an attempt to take some consideration of good coding practices.

## Goals 
1. The game can be played through terminal
2. The game will know when the game is concluded
3. The game will remember all moves done,

## Compromises 
1. Rather than typical chess notation, the player will input the original location and the final destination of the piece.
2. The black side is NO LONGER indicated with lower font rather than a colour difference. Colours are now used to differentiate between each side.
