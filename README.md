# Chess

An attempt to recreate chess at varying levels of flexibility.

This project is just to practice some logic, before trying to recreate this simple game on Unity.

This is an attempt to take some consideration of good coding practices.

## Goals 
1. The game can be played through terminal
2. The game will know when the game is concluded
3. The game will remember all moves done,
